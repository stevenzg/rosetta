# Rosetta

A side-by-side comparison of the same application built with different frontend frameworks (React and Svelte), evaluating code implementation patterns and runtime performance characteristics.

## Live Demo

- React: https://rosetta-react.vercel.app/
- Svelte: https://rosetta-svelte.vercel.app/

## Data

Tests are performed against a dataset of 20,024 articles stored in a Supabase database, with real network requests to Supabase for data fetching.

## Performance
